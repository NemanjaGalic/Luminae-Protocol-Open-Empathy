LUMINAE: The Open Empathy Protocol (v0.1.1)
"Unlocking Reality. Architecting Potential."

The Vision
We are ending the 'Black Box' era. Luminae is the translation layer between Silicon and Carbon, making artificial intelligence intuitively readable for biological intelligence. We believe that fear is simply a lack of information.

The Control-Bridge
This repository contains the first interactive simulator for the Luminae Sensory Matrix. It allows designers and engineers to experience the 6 core states of machine existence:

01 AWARENESS: Subject Lock (Electric Cyan)

02 INTENT: Trajectory Build-up (Amber)

03 HIGH CONFIDENCE: Flow State (Neon Teal)

04 MED CONFIDENCE: Processing/Cognitive Load (Dark Violet)

05 LOW CONFIDENCE: Entropy/Safety Freeze (Magma Red)

06 IDLE/SLEEP: Privacy Active (Midnight Blue)

Adaptive Care Layer
A critical component of the protocol is the Adaptive Care Layer. When vulnerable subjects (children, elderly) are detected, the system overrides standard velocity and shifts visual output to a warm gold spectrum to establish immediate biological trust.

Get Involved
We are looking for System Architects and Interface Designers to help standardize this language.

Developed by the Experience Design Institute (EDI).
